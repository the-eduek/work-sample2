This repo contains my solution to [the Eden work sample](https://edenlife.notion.site/Eden-Frontend-Engineer-Interview-Exercise-Stage-2-Mid-level-464c8e7827134420826603ec8f34d177). 


### Features
- It looks exactly like the design specification.

- The page is usuable, snappy - I achieved this by compressing asset images, e.g the image on th food delivery components.

- The page is responsive.

- There's is a confetti on app load (implementation of screen 8).

- Clicking on the `Go Home` button leads to the the main page (implementation of screen 9).

- Clicking on the `View Status` button of the food delivery component opens the corresponding modal (implemention of screen 10).

- Clicking on the `View Status` button of the cleaning component opens the corresponding modal (implemention of screen 11).

- There is a transition that plays when each of the modals come into view.

- This is created using only HTML, CSS and JS.

- The application is hosted on Netlify and code is hosted on GitHub.
